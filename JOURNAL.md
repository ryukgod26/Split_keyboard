I am Going to use a Guide to build a Split Keyboard and I will also add something of my own in the end in the keyboard. This is the Picture of the Parts i own and will use.![WhatsApp Image 2025-10-03 at 23.25.25_03dffe1d.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b4abef96bb363e17b5e1ad3d7da1051c5562ff9a/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-10-03%20at%2023.25.25_03dffe1d.jpg)
